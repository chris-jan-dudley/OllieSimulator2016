Welcome to HackSussex The Game

You play as "Master Hacker" and it's your job to keep the team tables destressed by going to them and solving their problems.

Use the arrow keys to travel to each of the tables. When you visit them, they'll turn green, showing that they're destressed.
When a table turns red, it's getting stressed, and needs visiting quickly!
As the day goes on, the team's get more tired, more stressed, and need more attention!

How long can YOU keep HackSussex running?
